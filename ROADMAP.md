# Congress Trades — QoL Roadmap

Authoritative backlog for quality-of-life improvements to the congress-trades pipeline (repo: `holmes1371/congress-trades`, live site: `holmes1371.github.io/congress-trades`). Edit in place; commit changes alongside code.

Always load the karpathy-guidelines skill before starting anything here.

Closed `[x]` items are archived in `COMPLETED.md` with their full post-mortem prose. Stubs below preserve the original numbering so past session summaries and commit messages still resolve.

## Last session summary

This section holds **exactly one block** — the current/most-recent session — and it MUST be short. The next agent needs a cold pickup, not a recap.

Strict rules for writing it:

1. **≤5 bullets, ≤1 sentence each where possible.** Trim ruthlessly. If a bullet needs a paragraph, the real content belongs in a design note or `COMPLETED.md`; link it.
2. **Only what is open, in-flight, or just-filed.** Do NOT restate design decisions, rationale, or commit-by-commit walkthroughs for closed items — those live in `COMPLETED.md`; the next agent can read them if needed.
3. **No standing guidance here.** Session rituals, soft-delete convention, commit discipline — all of that lives in "For future agents" below. Do not duplicate.
4. **No cross-session carry-overs.** If something is still broken session-to-session, file it as a numbered ROADMAP item instead of repeating it here.
5. **Replace in place.** Do not append a new block and archive the old one below.

**2026-04-21 (session 1)**

- Scaffolded the multi-session handoff framework: `ROADMAP.md`, `COMPLETED.md`, `design/README.md`, `design/soft-delete-convention.md`. Modeled on the kids-schedule-github setup.
- Backlog intentionally empty — items get filed as Tom surfaces them.
- Nothing else in flight.

## For future agents

Read this file at the start of any session where Tom mentions "congress-trades", "the QoL list", "the roadmap", or asks about the next feature. The prioritization below is settled — do not re-debate it without prompting. Work items in order unless Tom explicitly says otherwise.

Session discipline:

- Invoke the `karpathy-guidelines` skill via the Skill tool at the start of every session that touches code. Reading `reference/guidelines.md` directly does not count — the skill-load step is what anchors the discipline for the rest of the session.
- git commits need the `-c user.name=... -c user.email=...` flags since there's no default identity in this workspace.
- **Soft-delete convention, not `rm`.** The FUSE mount this repo lives on refuses `unlink` but permits `rename`. `rm` fails with `Operation not permitted` even under `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`; `mv` works. When you need to discard a file — most often a stale `.git/index.lock` or `.git/HEAD.lock` left by an interrupted git op — `mkdir -p .to_delete && mv <file> .to_delete/<tag>-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`. The folder isn't tracked (no `.gitkeep`); agents create it on demand so Tom can select-all-delete inside it without working around a stub file. Tom empties it manually from Windows periodically. Full convention + stale-lock recovery + corrupt-index recovery ritual at `design/soft-delete-convention.md`. Unlink warnings on a successful git commit (`warning: unable to unlink '.git/index.lock': Operation not permitted`) are cosmetic; the commit landed, move on.
- Before starting a non-trivial feature, write a short design note to `design/{feature-name}.md` capturing the scope, the decisions already made, and the test fixtures needed. A fresh session should be able to pick up mid-feature from that note plus the last commit, without re-litigating choices.
- Commit at every natural boundary, not just at feature completion. Half-finished work behind a clear commit message is recoverable; a dirty worktree is not.
- Use the built-in TodoWrite tool before starting each commit, and keep it current as you work. Tom watches the todo widget to see where you are in the plan; a stale or absent list means he can't track progress. At the start of every new commit, add/refresh todos for that commit's sub-tasks and mark one `in_progress`.
- **Flip `[ ]` → `[~]` as soon as Tom approves the plan for a backlog item — before the design note, before any code.** The status flag is there to tell the next agent what's actually in flight; flipping only at session end means a mid-session interruption leaves the item falsely marked "not started" even though a design note and half the commits exist. Record the flip in whichever commit introduces the first artifact for the item (usually the design note); if the plan is approved but no commit has landed yet, include the flip alongside the first real change so it doesn't need its own throwaway commit.
- End each session by updating this file — mark in-progress items, note any deviations or follow-ups — and commit the update. **Do not flip an item to `[x]` without explicit user signoff.** When the final code commit for an item lands, leave the item in `[~]`, record the SHA, and summarize what's pending manual verification. Tom pushes, tests manually, and either confirms the close (then the next session flips it to `[x]` with the SHA preserved) or returns feedback to address. Closing on your own reads as premature.
- **Update the "Last session summary" block between each commit during a multi-commit feature, not just at session end.** The block should always reflect what *just* landed and what's next, so a mid-feature handoff — mid-session or across agents — has a clean pickup point. The block is single-slot: replace in place, do not append. Older sessions' context lives in commit messages, `COMPLETED.md`, and `design/*.md`.
- **Closed items live in `COMPLETED.md`, not here.** When Tom signs off a `[~]` item, the next session moves its full prose into `COMPLETED.md` and leaves a one-line stub at the original item number in this file. Original numbers are stable — never renumber. When touching territory that overlaps a completed item, read its full entry in `COMPLETED.md` before re-deriving decisions.
- Honor the standing order: deterministic work lives in Python scripts; the agent does only judgment and interpretation. If a feature tempts you to move mechanical work into agent-handled text, push back.

Status legend:

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress — include a note with what is done and what remains
- `[x]` done — include the commit SHA
- `[-]` descoped / on hold — full prose preserved in "Descoped / on hold" at the bottom for possible future revival

## Backlog (priority order)

_(none yet — file items as they come up. Preserve original numbering once items land; never renumber.)_

## Descoped / on hold

Items parked here aren't dead — they're off the active queue but preserved in case priorities shift. Revive by moving the full prose back under "Backlog" at the original number and flipping `[-]` → `[ ]`.
